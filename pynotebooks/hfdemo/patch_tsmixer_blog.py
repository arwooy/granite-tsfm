#  # PatchTSMixer in HuggingFace - Getting Started
# 

# <div> <img src="./figures/forecasting.png" alt="Forecasting" style="width: 600px; text-align: center;"/></div>
# 
# 
# `PatchTSMixer` is a lightweight time-series modeling approach based on the MLP-Mixer architecture. It is proposed in [TSMixer: Lightweight MLP-Mixer Model for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09364.pdf) by IBM Research authors `Vijay Ekambaram`, `Arindam Jati`, `Nam Nguyen`, `Phanwadee Sinthong` and `Jayant Kalagnanam`.
# 
# For effective mindshare and to promote opensourcing - IBM Research joins hands with the HuggingFace team to opensource this model in HF.
# 
# In this [HuggingFace implementation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/patchtsmixer), we provide PatchTSMixerâ€™s capabilities to facilitate lightweight mixing across patches, channels, and hidden features for effective multivariate time series modeling. It also supports various attention mechanisms starting from simple gated attention to more complex self-attention blocks that can be customized accordingly. The model can be pretrained and subsequently used for various downstream tasks such as forecasting, classification, and regression.
# 
# `PatchTSMixer` outperforms state-of-the-art MLP and Transformer models in forecasting by a considerable margin of 8-60%. It also outperforms the latest strong benchmarks of Patch-Transformer models (by 1-2%) with a significant reduction in memory and runtime (2-3X). For more details, refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09364.pdf).
# 
# In this blog, we will demonstrate examples of getting started with PatchTSMixer. We will first demonstrate the forecasting capability of `PatchTSMixer` on the Electricity data. We will then demonstrate the transfer learning capability of PatchTSMixer by using the model trained on the Electricity to do zero-shot forecasting on the ETTH2 dataset.

# 
# 
# ## Objectives
# 
# 1. Demonstrate the use of the recently contributed Hugging Face model architectures for forecasting use-cases, including pre-training and fine-tuning.
# 
# 2. Illustrate how to perform transfer learning from a pretrained model, with various approaches for fine-tuning the model on a target dataset.
# 

# 
# ## PatchTSMixer Quick Overview 
# 
# <div> <img src="./figures/patch-tsmixer-arch.png" alt="Architecture" style="width: 800px;"/></div>
# 
# 
# `PatchTSMixer` begins by splitting a given input multivariate time series into a sequence of patches or windows. Subsequently, it passes the series to an embedding layer, which generates a multi-dimensional tensor.
# 
# 
# The multi-dimensional tensor is subsequently passed to the `PatchTSMixer` backbone, which is composed of a sequence of [MLP Mixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601) layers. Each MLP Mixer layer learns inter-patch, intra-patch, and inter-channel correlations through a series of permutation and MLP operations.
# `PatchTSMixer` also employs residual connections and gated attentions to prioritize important features. 
# 
# 
# <div> <img src="./figures/backbone_illustration.png" alt="Mixing" style="width: 800px;"/></div>
# 
# A sequence of these MLP Mixer layers like the above is used to construct the `PatchTSMixer` backbone. `PatchTSMixer` has a modular design to seamlessly support masked time series pre-training as well as direct time series forecasting. This is done by leveraging the backbone with a different masking strategies and model heads.

# 

# ## Installation
# This demo needs Huggingface [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for main modeling tasks, and IBM `tsfm` for auxiliary data pre-processing.
# We can install both by cloning the `tsfm` repository and following the below steps.
# 
# 1. Clone IBM Time Series Foundation Model Repository [`tsfm`](https://github.com/ibm/tsfm).
#     ```
#     git clone git@github.com:IBM/tsfm.git
#     cd tsfm
#     ```
# 2. Install `tsfm`. This will also install Huggingface `transformers` library and other dependencies.
#     ```
#     pip install .
#     ```
# 3. Test it with the following commands in a `python` terminal.
#     ```
#     from transformers import PatchTSMixerConfig
#     from tsfm_public.toolkit.dataset import ForecastDFDataset
#     ```

# ### Load and prepare datasets
# 
# In the next cell, please adjust the following parameters to suit your application:
# - `PRETRAIN_AGAIN`: Set this to `True` if you want to perform pretraining again. Note that this might take some time depending on the GPU availability. Otherwise, the already pretrained model will be used.
# - `dataset_path`: path to local .csv file, or web address to a csv file for the data of interest. Data is loaded with pandas, so anything supported by
# `pd.read_csv` is supported: (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html).
# - `timestamp_column`: column name containing timestamp information, use None if there is no such column
# - `id_columns`: List of column names specifying the IDs of different time series. If no ID column exists, use []
# - `forecast_columns`: List of columns to be modeled
# - `context_length`: The amount of historical data used as input to the model. Windows of the input time series data with length equal to
# `context_length` will be extracted from the input dataframe. In the case of a multi-time series dataset, the context windows will be created
# so that they are contained within a single time series (i.e., a single ID).
# - `forecast_horizon`: Number of timestamps to forecast in future.
# - `train_start_index`, `train_end_index`: the start and end indices in the loaded data which delineate the training data.
# - `valid_start_index`, `valid_end_index`: the start and end indices in the loaded data which delineate the validation data.
# - `test_start_index`, `test_end_index`: the start and end indices in the loaded data which delineate the test data.
# - `patch_length`: The patch length for the `PatchTSMixer` model. It is recommended to choose a value that evenly divides `context_length`.
# - `num_workers`: Number of dataloder workers in pytorch dataloader.
# - `batch_size`: Batch size.
# The data is first loaded into a Pandas dataframe and split into training, validation, and test parts. Then the pandas dataframes are converted
# to the appropriate torch dataset needed for training.

#  ## Configure the PatchTSMixer model
# 
#  The settings below control the different components in the PatchTSMixer model.
#   - `num_input_channels`: the number of input channels (or dimensions) in the time series data. This is
#     automatically set to the number for forecast columns.
#   - `context_length`: As described above, the amount of historical data used as input to the model.
#   - `prediction_length`: This is same as the forecast horizon as decribed above.
#   - `patch_length`: The length of the patches extracted from the context window (of length `context_length`).
#   - `patch_stride`: The stride used when extracting patches from the context window.
#   - `d_model`: Hidden feature dimension of the model.
#   - `num_layers`: The number of model layers.
#   - `expansion_factor`: Expansion factor to use inside MLP. Recommended range is 2-5. Larger value indicates more complex model.
#   - `dropout`: Dropout probability for all fully connected layers in the encoder.
#   - `head_dropout`: Dropout probability used in the head of the model.
#   - `mode`: PatchTSMixer operating mode. "common_channel"/"mix_channel". Common-channel works in channel-independent mode. For pretraining, use "common_channel".
#   - `scaling`: Per-window standard scaling. Recommended value: "std".

# # Part 2: Transfer Learning from Electicity to ETTH2

# In this section, we will demonstrate the transfer learning capability of the `PatchTSMixer` model.
# We use the model pretrained on Electricity dataset to do zeroshot testing on ETTH2 dataset.
# 
# 
# In Transfer Learning,  we will pretrain the model for a forecasting task on a `source` dataset. Then, we will use the
#  pretrained model for zero-shot forecasting on a `target` dataset. The zero-shot forecasting
#  performance will denote the `test` performance of the model in the `target` domain, without any
#  training on the target domain. Subsequently, we will do linear probing and (then) finetuning of
#  the pretrained model on the `train` part of the target data, and will validate the forecasting
#  performance on the `test` part of the target data. In this example, the source dataset is the Electricity dataset and the target dataset is ETTH2

# ## Transfer Learing on `ETTh2` data. All evaluations are on the `test` part of the `ETTh2` data.
# Step 1: Directly evaluate the electricity-pretrained model. This is the zero-shot performance.  
# Step 2: Evaluate after doing linear probing.  
# Step 3: Evaluate after doing full finetuning.
